        directions='''Now it's time to add the herbs.

This means add the galangal, lemongrass, tomato, chili, shallot, garlic, coriander, makrut leaf, and lime. This is the flavour of tom yum!

All you have to do is slice or smash everything to help release the flavours and so you can jam it into the bottle. I used my wooden pestle like a club, but you can use the side of a heavy knife, or karate.

Galangal - This is a root in the ginger family that smells amazing. In Thailand we use it in everything! If you can't find it fresh, DON'T use ginger because it will taste too weird. You can find dried galangal online and soak it in hot water to make it like new again!

Makrut lime leaf - This is also called kaffir lime leaf and you can usually find it frozen or dried. Frozen is better. Tear the leaf up to release its incredible scent!

Lemongrass - You can just use the softer, paler low part of the stem for a milder tste, or the leaves as well for something much stronger.

Shallot - I roasted my shallot over a burner first then peeled it and sliced it up. This gave the drink a slight smoky flavour, but it also tastes good raw.

Chilis - Put in as many as you want. One or two goes a long way, but it depends how hot you like it!

        stepTitle="Add the Vodka and Wait...",
        directions='''...but not long.

Go ahead and pour the vodka into the bigger bottle, or back from your pitcher into the original bottle, whichever you used.

Now put it in a dark place so that light doesn't dull the colours or the flavour.

You'll be surprised - after just one day your tom yum vodka will taste and especially smell great!

When it's ready, you can keep it in the refrigerator in this bottle with all the herbs inside because they are so pretty. Or you can pour just the alcohol back into the original vodka bottle and it will last a lot longer.

I think you can sip this vodka all on its own, but you can also mix it to make drinks like the best bloody mary ever.

It looks great when you serve it to your friends with all the herbs still inside, especially with some Thai food.

Thanks and I hope you enjoy my recipe!

Modeling chocolate is easier to sculpt as well, however, it does warm faster. I used this recipe for my toad cake instructable, so I know it works.

Supplies:

2 cups corn syrup
10 cups (454 grams) chocolate almond bark (light and dark chocolate)
*DOUBLE THE RECIPE*

I used Liz's recipe here: https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/modeling-chocola...

Steps:

Put the stove top on medium heat.
Melt the chocolate until it's smooth.
Add the corn syrup slowly when the chocolate is still hot, then stir it in until it resembles the consistency of unpulled taffy.
Dump the mixture onto some plastic wrap, spread it out, then seal it and place it in the fridge.
Cool overnight. Repeat for white and dark chocolate modeling chocolate.
Suggestions:

Make more modeling chocolate than you think you'll need! I doubled the recipe, and I still think I could have used a little more white modeling chocolate. And if you make too much, you can always freeze it for future projects.
If you're making an Instructable, don't forget to take pictures of your modeling chocolate like I did. :( Maybe you'll get lucky and already have some pictures on hand, but always double-check before moving to your next step!''')

Keep the lid on for 3-4 minutes and ensure all the sugar granules are dissolved.
Remove the lid, insert a candy thermometer carefully and continue cooking on medium-high until the syrup reaches 240° F.
When the sugar solution is at about 235° F, begin whipping the egg whites on high speed.
Add the salt to the egg whites.
When the egg whites reach soft peaks, pour the sugar solution in a steady stream on to the whipping whites while mixing on low speed. Be careful, the sugar is still extremely hot!
Continue whipping the egg/sugar mixture until it reaches stiff peaks. (Liz wraps an apron around the bowl with an ice pack to help the meringue cool down faster.)
Once the meringue is cooled, whip in soft butter and vanilla until the buttercream is light and fluffy and no longer has a butter taste. This can take from 10-15 minutes.
We thought caramel would be a good flavor to complement the vanilla flavor and gold coloring. Add a tablespoon of caramel syrup, then mix. Taste it, and add if you'd like. Add a little at a time so you don't wreck the frosting.
Add yellow and orange food coloring to achieve a light gold color.''')

If your cake is in one pan, cut it in half so you have two pieces. Trim it so it fits comfortably onto your cake board. *KEEP THE CAKE SCRAPS, YOU WILL NEED THEM LATER* If you want to, add simple syrup to your cakes and wait for it to soak in.
Slap a good amount of frosting onto one of your cake pieces. Not too much, unless you like frosting more than cake.
Place your other cake piece on top of your frosting layer.
Add a large amount of frosting ontop of your cake, then cover the entire cake in a thin layer of frosting. Insert into the fridge to chill overnight or for at least 3 hours.
Lightly draw a semi-circle towards the top of the cake. This is where No-Face will be sitting later. Cut a thin layer away so the circle is lower than the rest of the cake.
Draw a larger semi-circle, then carve the sides so they're rounded.
Add cake scraps to the side of the larger circle, starting with larger pieces on the bottom, and ending with smaller pieces on top.
Carve so the circles begin to resemble a bathtub. It doesn't have to be perfect, we'll be covering it in modeling chocolate later.
To make the bathtub appear taller, trim away a thin layer of the rest of the cake (where the food will be sitting).

Shape the cake dough into a blob-ish shape. The top should be thinner than the bottom. It's okay if it doesn't look beautiful, as No-Face is bumpy and blobby in the movie.
Roll a medium sheet of black-tinted dark chocolate modeling chocolate. Drape it over your cake pop blob, and smooth it gently. To add his hair, cut some brown modeling chocolate into spikes and add it to the top.
Roll a small ball of fondant, and squish it into an oval.
Use vodka and food coloring to paint his face. If you screw up, use more vodka to wipe the food coloring away.
Use a little buttercream to adhere his dried face to the cake pop blob.
Wrap two toothpicks in dark modeling chocolate.
Sculpt two tiny, outstretched hands. They don't have to look great, he is a spirit afterall.

And we're finished. Thank you for reading through this Instructable, I had a fun time making it AND the cake! If you want to make the cake even crazier, sculpt the frog-workers or add little hands inbetween the food. If I'm being honest though, I'm not expecting too many people to make this as a cake. However, cupcakes would be a fantastic idea, and much easier to execute. If you want to take the plunge though, all power to you! I won't give you any gold though.

        I always start with whole tomatoes to make them whatever size I want based on my recipe. For this recipe, I wanted my sauce to have more texture. I like how the chunkier tomato pieces hold on to the melted goat cheese, so I break up the whole tomatoes with my hands until I get the consistency I want. You can use tomatoes that are already crushed or diced. Add salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Simmer and reduce the sauce until it thickens. In the meantime, boil your water for the rigatoni. When the water reaches a roaring boil, salt your water. Salt your water like it’s swimming in the ocean. When you are cooking pasta in boiling water, it’s the only time you have a chance to flavor the actual noodles, so the saltier the water, the better

I read everything I could find about what makes a chocolate chip cookie truly outstanding, and gained the most insight from the experiment that inspired this one, performed by David Leite for the New York Times in July of 2008. Our results, however, differed, though the few secrets revealed in the article remain invaluable.

The key secret in making amazing chocolate chip cookies seems to be in how long you let the dough sit before baking. Even Mrs. Wakefield employed this technique when she invented the original Nestle Toll House recipe - it just didn't make it onto the package!

Leaving the dough in the fridge for 24-36 hours allows the ingredients to fully soak up the liquid, and result in a firmer dough which bakes to a better consistency.

A long hydration time is important because eggs, unlike, say, water, are gelatinous and slow-moving. And since butter coats the flour, it makes it difficult for the liquids to get through to the dry ingredients.

Another hint is to rotate the cookie sheet mid-way through baking. This allows your cookies to bake evenly, regardless of where the hottest part of your oven is. This simple trick was a game-changer for me, and I'll never do otherwise again!

The NYTimes article suggests there's no substitute for a 6" cookie whose dough has been left in the fridge for at least 36 hours. But after this experiment, I care to differ.''')

 2 cups (about 225 g) nuts (I prefer pecans in this recipe)
for 10 mintues on an ungreased cookie sheet. Let cool. If you don't it will cause your chocolate pieces to get melty in the batter. Which is what happened to me. Which I rather liked and will probably be doing again. So choose your own adventure.

While those are baking, chop up:

 14 ounces (400 g) bittersweet chocolate
Insider tip: for the ultimate cookie, use only chocolate with at least 60 percent cacao content and shoot for a ratio of chocolate to dough of no less than 40 to 60.''')

In a separate bowl (preferably with an electric mixer) beat together:

* 1 cup (8 ounces/225 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1 cup (215 g) packed light brown sugar
* 3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

One at a time, add:

* 2 eggs

beating thoroughly after each addition until each is incorporated.

Slowly stir in flour mixture until fully incorporated.

Though this is not in the original recipe, I strongly recommend saving apart a small portion of dough - 1/2 of one of the logs maybe, and proceeding to the next step. Not only will this quell your desire to break into the fridge at midnight and eat one whole log straight from the wrapper, it will give you the opportunity to compare and contrast the benefits of allowing your dough to rest.

So do it! Just don't tell David I said so. ;)''')

Scoochmaroo Super Tip: Sprinkle the cookie slices with a small amount of sea salt. This will really make them sing!

Bake the cookies for 10 minutes, rotating the sheet midway through. If you prefer a chewier cookie, scale back the time a bit

(how did I not get a picture of the cookies being baked? I don't know!!)

Let cookies cool on the baking sheet until firm enough to transfer to a wire rack.

Baked cookies will store in an airtight container for 4 days. Unbaked dough can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for up to a month.''')
